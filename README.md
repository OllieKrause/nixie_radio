# nixie_radio
A simple FM radio that uses nixie tubes to display frequency and volume. The radio does use a custom PCB so I've included the Autodesk Eagle .brd, .sch, and custom.lib files. I also included the CAM files which are compatible with JLCPCB's cheapest 2 layer PCB manufacturing service. You'll also find a BOM .csv file in the folder which can be uploaded to Digikey.

I want to give a huge thanks to andykarpov for his TEA5767 FM radio library which I've used extensively throughout this project. https://github.com/andykarpov/TEA5767

While the code and hardware have been tested, this project is still very much a work in progress and the user experience has yet to be optimized. 

I hope to document this project in much greater detail once I'm satisfied with the first prototype. 

Questions, comments, suggestions?
